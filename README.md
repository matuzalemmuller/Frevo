## Contribution

Want to collaborate? Luckily I have a good job, but not everyone has the same opportunities that I had. I will be happy if you donate to a [charity](https://www.globalgiving.org/) as it will motivate me to work on more projects so I know that I will be helping someone.


Also, feel free to fork and/or star the project!
