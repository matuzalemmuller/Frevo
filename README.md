## Installation

Download the `.dmg` package from the [releases](https://github.com/matuzalemmuller/Frevo/releases) page.

After dowloading the package, simply click in the `.dmg` file to mount it in your Mac and move the file `Frevo.app` to the "Applications" folder.

To start Frevo when the system starts, go to "System Preferences" -> "Users & Groups" -> "Login Items" and add Frevo to the list.

### *OSX 10.15 and later*

A warning will be displayed when the app is first launched because Frevo is not notarized. To open Frevo, right-click in the app and select "Open". A message saying that macOS cannot verify the developer of Frevo will be displayed. Click in "Open" again to start the app.
